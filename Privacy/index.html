<p>TTagit Privacy Policy</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when TTAGIT collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. TTAGIT receives your information through our various TTAGITbsites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, and commerce services (the “Services” or “TTAGIT”) and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use TTAGIT from our TTAGITbsite, post or receive TTTAGITets via SMS, or access TTAGIT from an application such as TTAGIT for Mac, TTAGIT for Android or TTTAGITetDeck. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize TTAGIT to use your information in the United States and any other country where TTAGIT operates.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@ttagit.com </p>

<p>Information Collection and Use<br>
  Tip TTAGIT collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.</p>

<p>Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure a TTAGIT account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. In some cases, you may be required to provide your phone number, for example, to use TTAGIT via SMS or to help twitter prevent spam, fraud, or abuse. Your name and username are listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search and public user profiles, do not require registration.</p>

<p>Additional Information: You may provide twitter with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your TTAGITbsite, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. TTAGITe may use your contact information to send you information about there Services or to market to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from TTAGIT. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on twitters TTAGITbsite. TTAGIT may use your contact information to help others find your TTAGIT account, including through third-party services and client applications. Your privacy settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may choose to upload your address book so that TTAGIT can help you find TTAGIT users you know or help other TTAGIT users find you. TTAGIT may later make suggestions to you and other users on TTAGIT based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts from TTAGIT at any time. If you email twitter, TTAGIT may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your TTAGIT account to your account on another service in order to cross-post betTTAGITen TTAGIT and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps twitter improve the Services, and is deleted from TTAGIT within a few TTAGITeks of your disconnecting from TTAGIT your account on the other service.  Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>

<p>TTTAGITets, Following, Lists and other Public Information: TTAGIT Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide twitter is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you TTTAGITet and the metadata provided with TTTAGITets, such as when you TTTAGITeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the TTTAGITets you mark as favorites or RetTTAGITet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. TTAGIT may use this information to customize the content twitter shows you, including ads. TTAGITs default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from TTAGIT, but twitter generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. TTAGIT Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public TTTAGITets are immediately delivered via SMS and twitters APIs to twitters partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate TTAGIT content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

<p>Location Information: You may choose to publish your location in your TTTAGITets and in your TTAGIT profile. You may also tell twitter your location when you set your trend location on TTAGIT.com or your computer or mobile device sends twitter location information. TTAGIT may also use other data from your device to determine location, for example, information about wireless networks or cell toTTAGITrs near your mobile device, or your IP address. TTAGIT may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as TTTAGITeting with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. </p>

<p>Links: TTAGIT may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. TTAGIT does this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the TTAGITbsites you visit. HoTTAGITver, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. </p>
